Kevin Roast has graciously given permission to include this benchmark in the
WebGL-2D project.

This benchmark is perfect for testing real world canvas usage in game engine.
It relies heavily on 9 arg drawImage cropping to implement scrolling
backgrounds and stripstrip animations.

Visit his website http://www.kevs3d.co.uk/ for other HTML5 canvas demos as
well as the asteroids game http://www.kevs3d.co.uk/dev/asteroids/
